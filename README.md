# Dalio Uncorrelated Returns Portfolio Management

This repository contains research and implementation of Ray Dalio's uncorrelated returns concept for portfolio management.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and implement portfolio management strategies based on Dalio's principle of creating uncorrelated return streams. This approach aims to build more robust portfolios by combining assets that have low correlation with each other, reducing overall portfolio risk while maintaining return potential.

## Getting Started

1. **Create and activate your own virtual environment**
   - On macOS / Linux:
     
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
2. **Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`**
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Start Jupyter and open the main notebook**
   
   Open `main.ipynb` to begin exploration.

4. **Review research materials**
   - Check the `research/` folder for context and references used in the analysis.
