# Dalio Uncorrelated Returns Portfolio Management

This repository contains research and implementation of Ray Dalio's uncorrelated returns concept for portfolio management.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and implement portfolio management strategies based on Dalio's principle of creating uncorrelated return streams. This approach aims to build more robust portfolios by combining assets that have low correlation with each other, reducing overall portfolio risk while maintaining return potential.
