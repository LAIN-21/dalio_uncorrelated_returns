Great question — this is a **core concept**, so let’s lock it in cleanly.

## What **“by factor”** means (plain English)

**“Equities (by factor)”** means grouping stocks **not by geography or sector**, but by the **systematic characteristics that explain how they behave**.

A **factor** is a **persistent driver of returns and risk** that shows up **across many stocks and across time**.

Think:

> *Why* do some stocks tend to outperform or behave differently — **independent of where they’re listed?**

Those “whys” are **factors**.

## The canonical definition (academic backbone)

Most of this comes from the work of **Eugene Fama** and **Kenneth French**, who showed that:

> Stock returns are largely explained by **exposure to a small number of common factors**, not by stock picking.

So instead of saying:

* “I like Apple”

You say:

* “I want exposure to **value**”
* “I want exposure to **momentum**”
* “I want exposure to **low volatility**”
