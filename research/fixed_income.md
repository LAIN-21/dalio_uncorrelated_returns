## Big picture: what is **fixed income**?

**Fixed income** is the part of the market where you **lend money** and get:

* Regular interest payments (coupon)
* Your principal back at maturity

The two main risks that define fixed income assets are:

1. **Interest-rate risk** → prices move when rates move
2. **Credit risk** → the borrower might not repay you

That’s why fixed income splits neatly into:

* **Government bonds (rates / duration)**
* **Credit (spreads / default risk)**

---

## 1️⃣ Government bonds (rates / duration)

These are loans to a **government** (e.g. U.S. Treasury).
They are considered **credit-risk free** (or very close), so the main risk is **interest rates**.

When rates go up → bond prices go down
When rates go down → bond prices go up

What differentiates them is **maturity (duration)**.

### ▸ Short-term — **T-Bills**

* Maturity: **a few weeks to 1 year**
* Very low interest-rate sensitivity
* Used as a **cash-like safe place to park money**
* Barely move in price

👉 Risk driver: almost none (very stable)

---

### ▸ Intermediate-term — **Notes**

* Maturity: **2 to ~10 years**
* Moderate interest-rate sensitivity
* Core “boring but useful” bond exposure

👉 Risk driver: rates matter, but not violently

---

### ▸ Long-term — **Bonds**

* Maturity: **20–30+ years**
* Very sensitive to interest-rate changes
* Big price swings when rates move

👉 Risk driver: **duration risk** (rates dominate everything)

---

## 2️⃣ Credit (spreads / default risk)

Here, you’re no longer lending to governments — you’re lending to **companies or weaker countries**.
Now, interest rates matter **less** than **credit risk**.

Instead of asking:

> “What will rates do?”

You ask:

> “Will this borrower survive?”

The key concept here is **credit spread**:

* Extra yield you earn **on top of government bonds**
* Compensation for default risk

---

### ▸ Investment-grade corporates

* Loans to **strong, stable companies**
* Low default risk
* Small spread over government bonds

👉 Risk driver: mild credit risk + some rate sensitivity
👉 Used for: conservative income, portfolio stability

---

### ▸ High-yield corporates (junk bonds)

* Loans to **riskier companies**
* Higher chance of default
* Much higher yields

👉 Risk driver: **economic cycles & company health**
👉 Behave more like stocks during crises

---

### ▸ Emerging-market debt

* Loans to **developing countries**
* Can be issued in USD or local currency
* Exposed to politics, FX risk, and global risk sentiment

👉 Risk driver: defaults, currency swings, geopolitics
👉 High return potential, high volatility

---

## Mental model to remember everything 🧠

**Government bonds**

* Risk = **interest rates**
* Question: *“How long am I lending for?”*

**Credit**

* Risk = **default**
* Question: *“Who am I lending to?”*

| Category         | Main Risk               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| T-Bills          | Almost none             |
| Notes            | Rates                   |
| Long bonds       | Rates (a lot)           |
| Investment-grade | Mild default risk       |
| High-yield       | Strong default risk     |
| Emerging markets | Default + FX + politics |
