# 1️⃣ Inflation Hedges

## What this category is

Inflation hedges are assets that **tend to hold value or benefit when inflation is higher than expected**.

Important point:

> Inflation hedges are defined by **behavior**, not by issuer.

Some are government-issued, some are real assets, some are financial hybrids.

You only need **two** here.

---

## A) **Inflation-linked government bonds (TIPS)**

### What this represents

* Direct protection against CPI inflation
* Government-backed
* Real (inflation-adjusted) yields

### How it works

* Principal increases when inflation rises
* Coupons are paid on the adjusted principal
* You are protected from *unexpected* inflation

---

### ETF to use

**ETF:** **`TIP`**
**Tracks:** US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

📌 Interpretation:

> “What if inflation surprises to the upside?”

This is the **purest financial inflation hedge**.

---

## B) **Commodity inflation hedge (real price inflation)**

You already partly cover this via commodities, but here it plays a **different role**.

### What this represents

* Inflation driven by **real goods**
* Supply shocks
* Energy & food inflation

---

### ETF to use

**ETF:** **`DBC`**
**Tracks:** Broad basket of commodity futures

📌 Interpretation:

> “Is inflation coming from real-world input prices?”

This complements TIPS:

* TIPS = CPI-linked, financial
* DBC = real-economy inflation

# 2️⃣ Volatility

## What volatility is (important)

Volatility is **not an asset** in the normal sense.

It is a **state variable**:

* Fear
* Uncertainty
* Stress

Volatility typically **spikes when everything else falls**.

That’s why it exists in the framework.

---

## Why ETFs are tricky here

Most volatility ETFs:

* Suffer from roll decay
* Are terrible long-term holdings
* Distort correlations

But for **structure discovery**, one proxy is enough.

---

## Volatility exposure (single representative)

### What this represents

* Market stress
* Risk-off regimes
* Crash protection (short-term)

---

### ETF to use

**ETF:** **`VXX`**
**Tracks:** Short-term VIX futures

📌 Interpretation:

> “Is market fear rising right now?”

This is **not** for buy-and-hold — it’s for:

* correlation analysis
* regime identification
* stress behavior

---

## Final Volatility set

```text

└── Equity market volatility → VXX
```

---

## One critical warning (read once)

* **Never treat VXX as an investment**
* It is a **measurement instrument**
* Perfectly valid for your research
* Dangerous for portfolios if misunderstood

You’re using it correctly.

# Final wrap-up (last anchor)

> **Inflation hedges protect purchasing power.
> Volatility measures fear.**

They serve **completely different purposes**, even though both react to stress.
